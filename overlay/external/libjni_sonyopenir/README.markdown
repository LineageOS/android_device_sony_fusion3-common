##About##
This library can either be used along side stand alone applications or within Android apk's as a JNI to enable the use of the UEI (Universal Electronics) IR blaster device. It was created with the Xperia Tablet Z in minde however it should work with little or no modifications on 
devices that make use of a similer IR blaster chip.


##Status##
Currently this libray includes the functionality to read and send raw key code data (learn and send). However the commands to send the pre
installed device codes are known but the database of devices are unavailable at this time.
